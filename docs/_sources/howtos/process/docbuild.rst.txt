Documentation Generation Guide
##############################

These instructions will walk you through generating the |PN| Project's
documentation and publishing it to the `documentation site`_.
You can also use these instructions to generate the |PN| documentation
on your local system.

Documentation overview
**********************

The |PN| Project content is written using the reStructuredText markup
language (.rst file extension) with Sphinx extensions, and processed
using Sphinx to create a formatted stand-alone website. Developers can
view this content either in its raw form as .rst markup files, or you
can generate the HTML content and view it with a web browser directly on
your workstation.

You can read details about `reStructuredText`_, and `Sphinx`_ from
their respective websites.

The project's documentation contains the following items:

* ReStructuredText source files used to generate documentation found at the
  `documentation site`_. All of the reStructuredText sources
  are found in the `documentation repo`_.

The reStructuredText files are processed by the Sphinx documentation system,
and make use of the breathe extension for including the doxygen-generated API
material.


Set up the documentation working folders
****************************************

You'll need git installed to get the working folders set up:

* For an Ubuntu development system use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo apt-get install git

* For a Fedora development system use

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo dnf install git

We use github.io
for publishing the generated documentation.
Here's the recommended local folder setup for documentation contributions
and generation:

.. code-block:: none

   projectname/
      doc-repo/

The parent folder ``projectname`` is there to make room for the
publishing area that will come later.  It's best if the ``doc-repo``
folder is an ssh clone of your personal fork of the upstream project
repos (though https clones work too):

#. Use your browser to visit the `documentation repo`_ and make a
   fork of the repo to your personal GitHub account.

   .. image:: images/fork-docs.png

#. Copy the clone URL of the GitHub repo:

   .. image:: images/copy-clone-url.png

#. At a command prompt, create the working folder and clone
   the `documentation repo`_ to your local computer (and if you
   have publishing rights, the `documentation site`_). If you don't have
   publishing rights, you'll still be able to generate the docs locally, but
   not publish them:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~
      mkdir project-name && cd project-name
      git clone git@github.com:<github-username>/<projectname>/<documentrepo>.git

#. For the cloned local repos, tell git about the upstream repo:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd doc-repo
      git remote add upstream git@github.com:<projectname>/<document-repo>.git

#. If you haven't done so already, be sure to configure git with your name
   and email address for the signed-off-by line in your commit messages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git config --global user.name "David Developer"
      git config --global user.email "david.developer@company.com"

Installing the documentation tools
**********************************

Our documentation processing has been tested to run with:

* Python 3.6.3
* Doxygen version 1.8.13
* Sphinx version 1.7.5
* Breathe version 4.9.1
* docutils version 0.14
* sphinx_rtd_theme version 0.4.0

The |PN| makes use of additional Sphinx extensions used for
creating drawings:

* sphinxcontrib-plantuml
* sphinx.ext.graphviz  (included with Sphinx)

.. note::  The plantuml extension uses Java to render the uml drawing
   syntax into an image. You'll need to have a Java runtime environment
   (JRE) installed when generating documentation.

Depending on your Linux version, install the needed tools:

* For Ubuntu use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo apt-get install doxygen python3-pip python3-wheel make default-jre

* For Fedora use:

  .. code-block:: bash

     sudo dnf install doxygen python3-pip python3-wheel make default-jre

And for either Linux environment, install the remaining python-based
tools:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/<projectname>/doc-repo
   pip3 install --user -r scripts/requirements.txt

And with that you're ready to generate the documentation.

Documentation presentation theme
********************************

Sphinx supports easy customization of the generated documentation
appearance through the use of themes.  Replace the theme files and do
another ``make html`` and the output layout and style is changed.
The ``read-the-docs`` theme is installed as part of the
``requirements.txt`` list above.

Running the documentation processors
************************************

The doc-repo directory has all the .rst source files, extra tools, and Makefile for
generating a local copy of the technical documentation.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/<projectname>/doc-repo
   make html

Depending on your development system, it will take about 10 seconds to
collect and generate the HTML content.  When done, you can view the HTML
output with your browser started at ``~/<projectname>/doc-repo/_build/html/index.html``

Publishing content
******************

If you have merge rights to the `documentation repo`_, you can update
the public project.

You'll need to do a one-time clone of the upstream repo (we publish
directly to the upstream repo rather than to a personal forked copy):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/<projectname>
   git clone git@github.com:<projectname>/<documentationrepo>.git

Then, after you've verified the generated HTML from ``make html`` looks
good, you can push directly to the publishing site with:

.. code-block:: bash

   make publish

This will delete everything in the publishing repo's **latest** folder
(in case the new version has
deleted files) and push a copy of the newly-generated HTML content
directly to the GitHub pages publishing repo. The `documentation site`_
will be updated within a few minutes, so it's best to verify the
locally generated html before publishing.
